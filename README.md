# Banking-System

The project is built with **C++ and QT Libs**

### In this project a banking system is implemented. In this system, you have two types of users: client and admin. Clients can open an account and perform some operations. The admin is also able to manage clients and processes.

 # Now i am going to describe some details about the project:

 # The abilities of admin:
 - Management of customer account opening requests
 * Add balance to the target customer's account
 + Close customer account
 - Lending to customers
 * Note: The admin's username is Admin and its password is adminramz

 # The abilities of clients:
 - View the code, address and phone number of different bank branches
 * Registration in the bank system
 + Login and logout
 - Opening a new account (each user can open 4 types of long-term, short-term, current, and saving accounts. For this, the user
    enters the desired information and sends her/his request. If the admin approves, the desired account will be opened for the user).
 * View existing accounts
 * Card, check and loan request for the desired account
 + Transfer funds to existing account numbers
 - Internet purchases, recharges, bill payments (by doing them, the desired amount of money will be deducted from the account.)
 * Editing information (editing information includes: mobile number, landline number, username, password and email)
 + Viewing the user's login and logout time
